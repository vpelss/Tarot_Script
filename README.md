# Tarot_Script

It is easily modifiable for any type of reading. You can use your own Tarot graphics or use the Rider-Waite. Layouts are determined by an HTML template. The card database is an easily modifiable text file.

The most flexible Tarot Card reader. Any spread is possible. The visitors name shows up in the reading giving it a personal touch! Instant (or delayed) Email tarot reading option is possible.

Our script allows you:
- To use your own images if you wish. (Either by renaming your card images or by editing the text based database.)
- Modify the deck descriptions if desired simply by editing a text based database. (It comes with two deck descriptions) So you can create tarot readings in any language!
- Make any spread you like just by editing an HTML template. (It comes with many pre designed spreads)
- Fully customize the look and design of the Tarot readings by simply modifying the HTML templates.
- Allows you to email Tarot readings to your visitors, if desired.
- Allows you to delay the emails if desired, thus making it seem that the reading came from a person. Your Web server must allow cron jobs for this module to work
- Has the ability to have a unique card description for each position in the Tarot spread. Eg: The 'Ten of Swords' card could read different in each position in the spread if you set up your database that way.
- Can be used to create other readings such as Rune readings, etc.
- Could be integrated into content management systems such as drupal if it allows php code and file() calls.
- And more is possible if you use your imagination...
