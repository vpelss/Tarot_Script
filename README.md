# Tarot_Script

It is easily modifiable for any type of reading. You can use your own Tarot graphics or use the Rider-Waite. Layouts are determined by an HTML template. The card database is an easily modifiable text file.

The most flexible Tarot Card reader ever. Any spread is possible. The users name shows up in the reading giving it a personal touch! Instant Email tarot reading option is included!

Our script allows you:
- To use your own images if you wish. (Either by renaming your card images or by editing the text based database.)
- Modify the deck descriptions if desired simply by editing a text based database. (It comes with two deck descriptions) So you can create tarot readings in any language!
- Make any spread you like just by editing an HTML template. (It comes with 4 pre designed spreads)
- Fully customise the look and design of the Tarot readings by modifying the HTML templates.
- Allows you to email Tarot readings to your visitors if desired.
- Allows you to delay the emails if desired, thus making it seem that the reading came from a person. Your Web server must allow cron jobs for this module to work
- Has the ability to have a unique card description for each position in the Tarot spread.
- Can be used to create other readings such as Rune readings, etc.
- It is easy to add your Tarot application to Facebook or Google Gadgets to increase visibility.
- Works with dotgo.com services so cell phones with texting can get your readings. See: https://www.dotgo.com/Publishers/Resources/DOTGOSimulator/ and type emogic.
- Could be integrated into content management systems such as drupal if it allows php code and file() calls.
- And more...
